bodytext: The January transfer window has always been a sellers' market, so the behaviour of buying clubs is a barometer of their blood pressure, on a scale ranging from contented to chaotic. Those who are content with where they are in the league decline to buy in haste at inflated prices and stick with squads they are generally happy with until the saner market of the summer. There are itchily ambitious clubs or those who cannot help themselves â€“ Roman Abramovich's Chelsea, paying Liverpool Â£50m for Fernando Torres two years ago, is forever the classic example â€“ but there were none in that impulsive bracket this time. In fact, considering this transfer window played out under the billowing prospect of Â£5bn expected for the Premier League's three-year TV deals from next season, there has been a notable measure of calm and evidence of more strategic, professional recruitment than some trolley dashes of old. Newcastle signed five French players, but say they were not knee-jerking at the sudden glimpse of the relegation zone but responding to it responsibly by bringing forward the signing of players they had tracked for some time. So, in a climate now characterised by more careful, statistics-based assessment of players' abilities and the financial implications, all of football looked at Queens Park Rangers' dealings as a club edging towards red on the barometer. Given the probable Â£60m a low-ranking Premier League club will be paid from television alone next season, compared with about Â£2m (plus parachute payments) for clubs in the Championship, it is natural to strain sinews to stay up. Tony Fernandes, QPR owner for only 18 months, was praised by his manager, Harry Redknapp, for spending Â£12.5m to buy out Christopher Samba's gilt-edged contract with Anzhi Makhachkala. That followed the Â£8m spent on LoÃ¯c Remy from Marseille, a deal worked on by the agent Willie McKay, a veteran of transfers from France to England, and so humble Loftus Road was the stand-out temple of extravagance in this transfer window. Samba's adviser, Walid Bouzid, said his client is not being paid the reported Â£100,000 weekly wage at Loftus Road but that the money is certainly "Premier League sized" and does not include a clause to decrease it if, despite these signings, QPR are relegated. Spending Â£20.5m in transfer fees and committing to many millions more in wages to two good players may be a rational effort by Fernandes to avoid greater losses if QPR are relegated but it is also a big-money January gamble. It is barely 18 months since a tough, muscular side managed by Neil Warnock convincingly won promotion to the Premier League and, having sacked Warnock and backed Mark Hughes to assemble a new collection last year, paying Â£6.8m in agents' fees, Fernandes should wonder how it came to this. Around him are clubs steadily increasing the sophistication of their scouting and signing of players, in the context of financial fair play which is promoting responsible spending. In the relegation zone Reading are not panicking in similar fashion, perhaps accepting that going down can keep a club strong if the Premier League bonanza has not been blown. Southampton's radical action to stay up was the brutal replacement of the manager, Nigel Adkins, with Mauricio Pochettino, rather than spending millions on players. Newcastle acknowledge their French signings in January were partly a response to finding Alan Pardew's squad sliding down the league but argue that the strategy helmed by the managing director, Derek Llambias, with the chief scout, Graham Carr, has identified good value nevertheless. By contrast the decision by Aston Villa's owner, Randy Lerner, not to sign any players now might come to seem like paralysis rather than confidence that Villa's form will improve between now and May. At clubs in safer regions of the table the general lack of panic buying, or very much newsworthy activity, speaks of a satisfaction with squads likely to ensure survival at least in the golden league. Swansea's chairman, Huw Jenkins, had said they identified two or three potential targets to strengthen Michael Laudrup's squad now but, with terms and conditions not being ideal and the team surpassing expectations, they had the luxury of waiting until the summer. Towards the top Arsenal expressed customary forbearance, while Everton and Tottenham Hotspur both worked hard to secure quality signings who could help grasp the fourth Champions League place. Manchester City always said, in the first flushes of Sheikh Mansour's mountainous spending, that they had a strategy, supported by a director of football structure, and would not continue splashing out every window. This time City, who are confident they will pass Uefa's financial fair play assessment next year, bought no new players, only selling â€“ Mario Balotelli for a satisfactory Â£17m plus add-ons. Manchester United, top of the league, were never going to indulge too much in January but pocketed Wilfried Zaha for the future. At Chelsea Abramovich sated his oligarch's impulses by introducing Rafael BenÃ­tez as interim manager and, despite his team's imperfections, offered no repeat of the Torres drama. Liverpool, financial fair play devotees, now operate a line of decision-making via Michael Edwards, head of performance and analysis. Their Â£12m signing of Daniel Sturridge and Â£8.5m spent on Philippe Coutinho do not quite look like Michu-like steals for a new edition of Moneyball. But still the club's owners, Fenway Sports Group, getting to grips with soccer, must look back and wonder how, in their first weeks in charge, they allowed themselves to blow the Torres money by spending Â£35m on Andy Carroll. Gradually â€“ away from QPR â€“ times are changing.

trailText: Stoke have signed the Birmingham goalkeeper Jack Butland, who made his England debut in August, for £4m
webPublicationDate: 2013-01-31T23:29:39Z
bodytext: Stoke City have signed Jack Butland from Birmingham City for £4m, with the 19-year-old goalkeeper, who made his full England debut in August, returning to St Andrew's on loan for the remainder of the season as part of the deal. Butland became Stoke's second capture of deadline night, after they had brought in the United States winger Brek Shea from FC Dallas for £2.5m. Butland has attracted interest from a number of Premier League clubs, including Chelsea, Southampton and Fulham, but he was determined to continue playing first-team football and is confident he will get that chance at Stoke. Although Asmir Begovic is the No1 at Stoke, leading Premier League clubs have been tracking the Bosnian and it looks increasingly likely that he will depart in the summer. Should that be the case, Butland would be expected to be given an opportunity to stake his claim for a regular starting place at the Britannia Stadium. Butland said: "It's been an incredible day â€“ a very exciting one, but I'm glad it's finished. I love playing and I don't want to sit on the bench. For me it was important I went to a club where I can play and develop my game." Of his return to Birmingham on loan Butland said: "I've got unfinished business there and I want to help them this season. They have been very good to me." Chelsea made an inquiry for Butland but the European champions' interest failed to materialise into a formal offer, with the teenager making it clear that he had no desire to move to Stamford Bridge and sit on the bench. Butland has been an ever-present for Birmingham this season and believes his development has been greatly helped by playing first-team football at such a young age. He represented Team GB in the Olympics and has impressed Roy Hodgson, the England manager, with his maturity as well as his ability. Butland was called up to the England squad for Euro 2012 after the third-choice goalkeeper John Ruddy broke a finger. Hodgson has named Butland in the England squad for the Brazil friendly on Wednesday. Birmingham were keen to sell Butland because of their parlous financial position. They turned down a £6m offer from Southampton in the summer but their bargaining power was severely reduced. It is believed Stoke are paying a significant part of the £4m fee up front, which will help tide Birmingham over in the short term. Stoke may also include a couple of loan players as part of the deal. Shea has signed a four-and-a-half-year contract at the Britannia Stadium after being granted a work permit. Stoke's manager, Tony Pulis, told the club's website: "Brek is a very, very exciting player, and one who we firmly believe could go on to become an outstanding player for this football club. He has terrific pace, a very good left foot and is capable of scoring goals. He has all the tools needed to be a success here." Rory Delap has agreed a loan move to Barnsley until the end of the season.

webPublicationDate: 2013-01-31T23:29:01Z
bodytext: There's no shortage of gleefully dumb, party-hard garage-rock bands out there these days, but LA's Fidlar seem intent on being dumber and party-hardier than any of them â€“ or at least on giving that impression. "I drink cheap beer! So what! Fuck you!" goes the opening song's chorus; the band's name itself apparently stands for "Fuck it dog, life's a risk." That's the agenda set, then, and they certainly stick to it, as one raucous tale of cartoonishly conspicuous, Yolo-driven wastedness leads to another, and another â€¦ and another. There's a bit more variation in the music, flitting between sugar-rush pop-punk, faintly 50s-ish pre-Beatles rock'n'roll and hints of the boomy drama of 60s garage. Once or twice they really hit the spot â€“ No Waves could hardly be catchier, and Black Out Stout could have the Black Lips looking over their shoulder â€“ but more often they don't. It's all oddly professional, too, which somewhat deflates the whole wild-abandon thing, and when the likes of Nobunny and King Tuff (to name but two) manage to infuse their similarly profane three-chord rackets with so much more personality and imagination, Fidlar might just leave you craving a quiet night in.

bodytext: As a minister, Margaret Hodge never convinced; as chair of the public accounts committee she has shone. The PAC has long been, as Professor Peter Hennessy says, "the queen of the select committees", terrifying government departments and agencies. But Ms Hodge's innovation, since taking the chair in 2010, has been to focus on a private-sector problem: tax avoidance. Since Christmas, the PAC has laid into Google, Starbucks and Amazon for their "immoral" use of loopholes to duck paying tax. She has allied her frontbencher's instinct for where public interest lies with a backbench pugnacity. Today's hearing of the Big Four accountancy firms summed up the Hodge style. Platitudes about customer service were cut short with a bark â€“ and a tetchy demand that the suits get to the point. This was no mere showmanship, but produced that an unlikely thing: a sparky and informative conversation about accountancy.

bodytext: Today's landmark buildings are no longer merely opened: they are launched, inaugurated, paraded before journalists. Before the occupants even move in, a flashy office or block of million-pound flats will have launched a fistful of press releases. So it is with the Shard. In the past few months, London's latest skyscraper has been launched with a laser show along the Thames and a banquet for Prince Andrew and the Qatari prime minister; has celebrated its completion and been the site of a royal abseiling competition. On Friday the tallest tower in Europe is finally open to the public. Much of the commentary that will inevitably follow will focus on the jutting Renzo Piano&nbsp;architecture and its views out to the North Sea. But there is another way of seeing the Shard: as a metaphor of how Britain today is becoming ever more unequal and dangerously lopsided. Set in one of the most deprived parts of London, the Shard is pretty much off-limits to its neighbours, who will not be able to afford&nbsp;a&nbsp;bed in the five-star hotel, let alone one of the £30-£50m flats. They might get up to its viewing gallery but, at £25 for an adult and £19 for a child, they might well find other uses for the cash. Such extreme exclusivity is no accident. Developer Irvine Sellar proudly talks of his "virtual town". The pricey office space is intended for hedge funders and management consultants. Given that more than one in three children in the local borough of Southwark receive free school meals, it is unlikely that too many of their parents will be employed inside. Finance now occupies an unprecedented amount of physical space in London: from the Square Mile to Canary Wharf and Mayfair and now the South Bank. But while finance is good at renting out pricey office blocks, it's terrible at creating jobs. Even during the boom, the entire industry generated almost no net new jobs. As late as the 80s, commercial buildings were largely owned by the businesses that occupied them. Now they are increasingly in the hands of absentee investors. A 2011 Cambridge study found that 52% of City offices&nbsp;were owned by&nbsp;foreign landlords, up&nbsp;from 8% in 1980. Any Treasury official will tell you that&nbsp;there&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;good case for foreign&nbsp;investment, in roads or factories. But&nbsp;this foreign money is flooding into safe London&nbsp;property â€“ and staying there. At least, until a crash comes. In the&nbsp;end,&nbsp;the Shard underlines what a one-horse town London is&nbsp;becoming, in the thrall of finance and a&nbsp;home to the world's hot money. During good times, this model may make London a&nbsp;wealthy city; it does nothing for the prosperity of most Londoners.

trailText: It is to Cameron's credit that he is not a control freak, but nothing a prime minister says or does is without political consequence
webPublicationDate: 2013-01-31T23:15:57Z
bodytext: The recent return of Yes, Prime Minister to the television screen has been greeted with disappointingly lukewarm reviews. Now, perhaps sensing a gap in the Whitehall comedy show market, the real prime minister did his best to make amends by triggering a political kerfuffle in the best traditions of Jim Hacker. Talking to journalists on his way to Algiers on Wednesday, David Cameron dropped a heavy hint that the defence budget would be protected from further cuts in this year's mini spending review covering the year 2015-16. The travelling press duly reported his remarks, with some treating them as a promise to increase defence spending above inflation for the rest of the current decade. On arrival in Algiers, Downing Street officials appeared to stand the story up still more firmly, saying that Mr Cameron would honour his earlier pledge to increase defence spending from 2015. Others stretched the story even further, implying that the promised extra spending would help ensure that Britain could engage against Islamic terrorists in north Africa, as unnamed service chiefs were allegedly urging on Mr Cameron. Commentators inevitably began to speculate on the spending implications for other ministers, suddenly facing fresh departmental budget cuts in order to pay for the PM's apparent largesse towards the Ministry of Defence. Everything appeared to reinforce the narrative that Mr Cameron, the light of battle in his eyes and anxious to offer real commitments to regional regimes, was prepared to cut further at home in order to boost the fight against terrorism in the desert. There was, however, a problem. The narrative was wrong. UK defence spending in Mali and north Africa is not so great that it requires a rewriting of the defence budget either now or in the foreseeable future. The money is there already. More embarrassingly, Mr Cameron was wrong to hint that current cuts in defence spending would be put into reverse from 2015. That is not his government's policy. Officials scrambled to get their new story straight. The defence budget would not, after all, be protected from cuts in the 2015-16 review, they announced. Further cuts to the military remained a real possibility. A pre-existing commitment that the defence equipment budget will rise by 1% in real terms from 2016 to 2020 stays. For the rest, though, it was a clear case of No, Prime Minister. This is not, however, an episode in a comedy series but an episode in real live politics. Naturally, Mr Cameron is entitled to be cut a bit of slack to make an occasional mistake. The demands on party leaders to know everything about everything are absurd. It is a tribute to all modern PMs that they manage to keep abreast of as much as they do. And it is to Mr Cameron's credit that he is not, unlike some of his predecessors, a political control freak. Nevertheless, nothing a prime minister says or does is without political consequence. The clear inference from the hastily revised Downing Street version is that the non-equipment part of the defence budget â€“ which is mostly made up of people â€“ could face another round of cuts, not just in 2015 but in the years that follow. Smart observers will also note that the clarified version of the policy allows George Osborne to cut defence back to a significantly lower baseline in 2015-16 so that the 1% rises in equipment spending make less demand on the Treasury in subsequent years. All prime ministers go off-piste sometimes. Tony Blair famously did so deliberately on health spending, with major consequences. Mr Cameron's piece of freelance, by contrast, may be soon forgotten by the public, though not by the newspapers that have been beating the drum for higher defence spending at the expense, in particular, of the aid budget. Yet it was an episode that illustrates a political reality. Today, spending more in one department means spending less in others. Every party faces choices of this kind as their general election offers begin to take shape. Mr Cameron's confusion this week was another sign that his instincts are too often the wrong ones.

bodytext: Watch David Beckham's unveiling as a PSG player. The transfer window has closed. David Beckham is a PSG player. Nacho Monreal has just become an Arsenal player. Chris Samba, Jermaine Jenas and Andros Towsend are QPR players. Jack Butland is a Stoke goalkeeper. Peter Odemwingie has turned into a pumpkin. He's talking to Sky now and of the Odemwingie fiasco he says: "I think he probably felt a deal had been done between the clubs and it hadn't ... there was bit of a mix-up, I feel sorry for the lad. Wires got crossed somewhere." Looking slightly haggard, Redknapps says the transfer window has been "OK. Some of it's been frustrating. We took the two lads from Tottenham (Jenas and Townsend) who I think are good players." The definition of desperation? It just might be this utterance from Jim White. "Things are gathering pace now - Xisco has been released by Newcastle." Lots of Sky reports accompanied by nothing but tumbleweed outside assorted stadiums. There is a definite sense of things petering out on this transfer period. "A bit disappointed in 'Arry," sighs Shooby Taylor. "I was expecting that wheela deala to make some big moves but it turns out my missus could do betta' than tha'." Brighton have clinched Matthew Upson on a deal until the end of the season. Fulham have signed Cameroonian midfielder Eyong Enoh on loan from Ajax. "I'm starting to think Paul Lambert is using Champ Manager to search players and doesn't know quite how to work the filter," muses Ben Bennett. Meanwhile, Norwich have confirmed that they will not be making any further bids for Gary Hooper. "Everton have made their first signing of the January window," confirms Andy Hunter. "Having seen an £8.6m deal for Leroy Fer collapse due to a problem with the Dutch international's knee, and then inquired about Alvaro Negredo of Sevilla, it is John Stones of Barnsley who has provided their first breakthrough. The England Under-19 international right-back will cost around £3m. Magaye Gueye, meanwhile, is heading out on loan." Sheffield United have signed Barry Robson from Middlesbrough. See, deals are being done. "We are hearing that deals are being done!" promises Jim White. He's just taunting Odemwingie now, isn't he? Jermain Jenas has completed his transfer to QPR, signing an 18-month contract. Jermain Jenas, Odemwingie Jealous. Aston Villa's plan to propel themselves out of the relegation zone has just got a boost as they have completed the loan capture of ... Simon Dawkins. Here's what the Spurs' website tells us about the 25-year-old striker: The striker re-signed for the Club having initially been released at the end of the 2008-09 season following lengthy battles with injury problems. Loaned to our partner club San Jose Earthquakes in 2011, Simon was a hit in the MLS and re-joined teh Earthquakes for the 2012 campaign. He had a purple patch in August and September, scoring four goals in as many appearances as the Earthquakes pushed for the Western Division title. Simon joined our Academy in 2004-05 after making 20 appearances for our Under-17s while still a schoolboy in 2003-04. He made an instant impact but missed most of the 2006-07 season having enjoyed a positive 2005-06 campaign for both reserves and our Under-18s. Simon returned to fitness for the start of the 2007-08 season and was named on the First Team substitute's bench for our UEFA Cup first round, second leg tie against Anorthosis Famagusta in October 2007. He continued to score goals in our Reserves for the remainder of that season before joining Leyton Orient on loan at the Rory Delap has left Stoke for Barnsley. "Perhaps Michael Owen should practice his throwing, he might get a game then," chortles Mark Judd. Here's the official word from Southampton's press officer. Space is being created at Loftus Road: DJ Campbell is at Blackburn talking about a move. There's someone at the door at Guardian HQ. Should I leave my chair to answer it? Or just assume it's Peter Odemwingie and ignore it? There's not a great deal happening at the moment. Sky Sports News are flailing. This sums it up: Not, not another potato break for me, rather mutterings of Celtic being about to spring Kevin Doyle from Wolves. Our man David Hytner has the lowdown on Spurs' striker search. "Tottenham Hotspur failed in a deadline day bid to sign their long-time target Leandro DamiÃ£o, although they were given hope that a deal for the Brazil and Internacional striker could be struck in the summer." Read more here. "I'm just looking through the completed deals," discloses Matt Dony. "Godsway Donyoh from Right To Dream Academy to Manchester City? That's the most magical sounding transfer ever. Up until the Manchester City part, obviously." What's more, the Ghanaian has been sent straight out on loan to Djurgarden in Sweden. QPR's press officer has just tweet thus: It's not all chinwagging tonight: there is some actual footballing taking place tonight too. And Leicester have just gone 2-1 up on Wolves thanks to David Nugent. Simon Jordan, speaking on Sky Sports News, has just made a sarky quip about the generosity of Christoper Samba returning from Anzhi to selflessly help QPR's relegation fight. "I think I feel your tongue in my cheek," commented Jim White, whereupon I think I felt a nation's eyebrows rise.&nbsp; Apparently Peter Odemwingie has left Loftus Road. Where could he be heading next? To the 02 to book himself in for a 14-night tour? To Downing Street? Somen Tchoyi, who once looked a decent prospect at WBA before being released last year and failing to impress during trials at Wolves and Birmingham, has pitched up in the Bundesliga, where Augsburg have just taken him on. Denials are now wafting out of Upton Park about the reported bid for DiamÃ©. Meanwhile, contradictory noises are emanating from White Hart Lane, with some suggesting the proposed deal for Leandro Damiao is definitely off and some saying it may still get done. That's textbook rolling news for you right there and don't you dare say it's irritating and worthless. Paul Scharner is back at Wigan, on loan from Hamburg. Leeds have nabbed Stephen Warnock from Aston Villa. Brek Shea has almost completed his move from FC Dallas to Stoke. All that remains is for the government to give him a work permit. "I'm excited," he tells Sky exclusively through his car window, as assorted Stokies engage in some tardy carol singing around the vehicle. Apparently Norwich's latest offer for Hooper was £9.2m but Celtic are still saying no. Sky, meanwhile, are saying that the Bhoys are about to sign a young Swedish keeper called Victor Noring. "I hope you're suitably attired for the drama about to unfold, Paul," burbles Simon McMahon. "On Sky, Jim White and Natalie Sawyer are actually colour co-ordinated. You're not telling me that's a coincidence." It's true that White is wearing a yellow tie to go with Sawyer yellow frock. And yes, I am coordinated too: my outfit matches my hairdo. I am bald. Feel free to imagine the scene at Guardian HQ. ... has just gone in and apparently Celtic are about to reject it. Either Chris Hughton is going up in increments of 50p or Neil Lennon is really determined to hang on to his striker. West Ham have had a bid from an undisclosed Premier League club for Mohamed DiamÃ©. The bid matches the value of the player's buy-out clause so the ball is now in his court. I'm guessing it's Arsenal. "I see you described Gregg Bakowsky as a 'devout Liverpool fan," observes Daniel Harris. "That's exceptional, though 'moderate' might work too. Are Evertonians 'staunch'?" That works for me. So does "hard-boiled". Stoke fans are raucous, Chelsea's spoiled. And Newcastle fans are, of course, perennially patronised. WBA have just posted the following statement on their website, which appears to indicate that Odemwingie has simply driven down to Loftus Road off his own bat in an attempt to make a move to QPR happen. While you reading that, I'm popping over to PSG to get the ball roling on my appointment as the club's lavishly-remunerated in-house MBMer. ALBION have moved to clarify developments regarding Peter Odemwingie after the striker was filmed a short while ago arriving at Loftus Road. The club can confirm they have held further discussions with QPR today but those talks have so far proven fruitless and no agreement has been reached. Albion would also like to make clear that Peter has not been given permission to speak to QPR about a potential move. Incorrect potato data from the boy Bakowski there. I had rice and beans owing to a lack of sufficiently high-calibre spuds. I am, therefore, not satisfied. I am guessing that you, too, are highly unsatisfied with this entry so far, so how about this: Pepe Reina is on his way to Arsenal! Or, at least, that's what several hacks are saying on twitter. Paul Doyle, satisfied and fully refreshed after eating a giant baked potato, is going to take over again. He may have some interesting goalkeeper news, too. Ta ra. Liverpool's Suso ain't Walking the Road to Wigan Pier â€¦ Those pesky sources at Sky say a deal has been agreed between Arsenal and Malaga for the left-back-who-is-definitely-better-than-AndrÃ©-Santos, Nacho Monreal. It's believed to be around £8.5m. It's now up to Monreal to see how much cash per week he can squeeze out of that renowned socialist ArsÃ¨ne Wenger. Jermaine Jenas has been doorstepped outside Loftus Road because the doors are locked to the stadium and the poor sap has to stand around outside. Perhaps Harry Redknapp has had a change of heart. "I'm signing for a top club," says Jermaine. They're actually bottom, but ho hum.&nbsp; Jacob Bonehill writes to shed some light on the O'Leary/Richard Dunne/Jay Jay Okocha missive: "I'm in Birmingham right now not too far from Villa Park, guess I could check out the O'leary et al story were it not for two reasons: firstly I'm in a suit which is the equivalent of wearing a target on your back down there (I cover the area for work, always jeans and trainers). Secondly, if it was true I might have to go and jump off a bridge over the expressway in despair â€¦ We're in trouble, but not that much trouble. Oh and the crown is in Birchfield/Perry Barr definitely not Witton which thankfully suggests a wind-up merchant." But I really want it to be true, Jacob. Have a peek will you â€¦ I've not heard anything more on the Arsenal deal for Malaga's Nacho Monreal, but I presume numbers are being tapped into computers, sweaty suits are running around and papers are being shuffled vigorously. I can tell you that Peter Odemwingie has turned up at Loftus Road, however. That deal will only be done if he drives over the metaphorical speedhump that is Junior Hoilett. QPR are not willing to let him go on loan to West Brom as part of the deal. PSV fan Joost de Boer has popped up in my inbox to trample all over Fulham fans' expectations for their new loan-signing Stanislav Manolev. "He's the worst player I've ever seen to play that many games for PSV. He can't defend, is always rushing forward but he can't actually pass a ball. Worst signing of the transfer window. So have fun!" What? A shocking defender in the Premier League? He'll fit right in Joost. I really hope roll-up man turns up at Stoke to pierce the bubble of faux-excitement. I've just tried to embed a tweet but it didn't work. Thanks technology. It wasn't even funny. Essentially, Ray Von from Phoenix Nights (Neil Fitzmaurice) reckons Liverpool have had a loan deal for Roma's Maaten Stekelenburg accepted with an option to sign him permanently for £7m. I have no idea who Ray Von's contacts are but there you have it. That last deal Liverpool did for a Roma goalkeeper went so well I suppose â€¦ Having smuggled one Brazilian into Anfield in Coutinho, Liverpool have bundled another out in their goalkeeper Doni, who has left the club for the Brazilian side Botafogo. His Liverpool career pretty much consisted of receiving a red card at Ewood Park. Another former player 'Arry was after, Peter Crouch, is not signing for QPR. He's staying at Stoke, who presumably wanted a bit more than the £5m that was slid across the table by QPR suits. Meanwhile, QPR's (do any of these deals not involve QPR) DJ Campbell is in deepest, darkest east Lancashire where he is in talks with Blackburn. 'Arry's QPR are in talks to sign Jermaine Jenas from Spurs. That's Jenas who has played about 12 times in the past two years. It seems if they're desperate in January, relatively new managers just revert to who they know. I fully expect Robbie Keane's name to mentioned again in the next 20 minutes. Apparently the Blackpool striker Stephen Dobbie is off to sign for Crystal Palace too. He's been on loan at Brighton this season but Holloway just can't keep his mitts off his former players. So if he starts up front with Phillips that will be a strike-force with a combined age of 69. I've just received an email from Hugh O'Dea that I presumed was a wind-up. Here it is: "I just saw Richie Dunne, David O'Leary and Jay Jay Okocha sipping on what looked like a hot whisky in 'The Old Crown and Cushion' pub in Witton, outside the villa grounds. I had been hearing rumours that he may be taking over from Paul Lambert but never thought anything of it." So far, so ridiculous. "I'm very&nbsp;bemused&nbsp;at the appearance of Okocha. Can anyone shed some light?" It's this last line that makes me wonder whether they really are sat in said drinking hole. I'd like to imagine that they are. Maybe they're waiting for a pub quiz to start. Or perhaps it's happy hour. Evening. Gregg here. Paul's currently prodding the potatoes to see which one has the crispiest skin. Meanwhile, I'm temporarily sat in his seat. It's quite a hot seat. Particularly given that I now have the responsibility of bringing you such transfer news gems as Crystal Palace signing Kevin Phillips. That sounds like a deal that could have been struck in 1996. He's 40 in July. Yes, 40. He's still score a goal or two from them, I'm sure.&nbsp; I'm off for my daily potato. Gregg Bakowski is your new MC. As a devout Liverpool fan, he will be happy to serve as a shoulder for Everton fans to cry on if the Fellaini to PSG thing comes true. "I am watching the Beckham circus and on one of the French TV channels very close to PSG (they own it) has reported that FELLIANI could be a PSG player today!" booms Sandrine Kane. "Sorry Everton fans!" Lewis also says that Fulham are trying to wangle a deal for Lyon striker BafÃ© Gomis. Meanwhile, Chelsea fans' disgruntlement grows: "I know Rafa said no more transfers in January but we still need a midfielder and I don't think Roman or Emenalo share their thoughts with Rafa," blubs Mihir Khatwani. "I think a big money signing at the end is our only hope." Nah, only messing: it's more bad news. Well, not news as such, rather rumours which could be entirely baseless but are worth mentioning for, um, the sake of heaping despair on already-suffering supporters. Sorry about that. Anyway, here it is: whispers in Belgium claim Manchester City are contemplating making a late bid to take Christian Benteke away from Villa and seal the struggling club's relegation. Sid Lowe says this of Nacho Monreal. "Tidy, well-positioned, decent on ball, steady full back. I like him." Meanwhile, Bordeaux have moved to replace Yoann Gouffran, who, of course, has joined Newcastle. They've bought 19-year-old Uruguayan defender Diego Rolani from Sporting Lisbon. Harry Redknapp has ruled out a return for Peter Crouch to Loftus Road. By some calculations that means the striker could be signing in roughly two hours. Apparently there is all manner of wacky hi-jinks going on at Nacho Morel's wikipedia page. Claim after sensational claim has appeared, some making reference to unusual anatomical features and others alluding to curious personal habits. All false, of course, but let's not be a sticklers for truth when there are giggles to be had. Oh, and speaking of wacky hi-jinks, lest we forget. Like the fabled pussy cat, Peter Odemwingie is on his way to London to see the Queen('s Park Rangers). Either he's going to sign there, or frighten a little mouse under a chair.&nbsp; Kieron Dyer has been training with Middlesbrough today and is expected to put pen to paper any moment now. And then, presumably, write his name on it. A Sky reporter who looks close to congealing outside Everton's trainibng ground has managed to mouth words suggesting that David Moyes may be about to sign a new right-back in the person of Barnsley's John Stones, which is bad news for Wigan, who also wanted him and have already, apparently, missed out on Aiden McGeady today. Specifically, the ones about spending some flipping money. Word from Spain is that they are closing in on Malaga's Nacho Monreal, a left-back. The fee has been rumoured to be around £10m but presumably that will rise if Arsenal insist on Malaga's taking Andre Santos off their hands too. Anzhi Mackhachkala seem to have blown Chelsea and everyone else out of the water by offering £36m for Shakhtar's silky Brazilian Willian. That is what is officially known as a mega-deal. Spurs continue to serenade Damiao but they have others irons in the fire too: word is they're nattering with Lyon about Lisandro Lopes. Juventus have apparently been put off the Argentinian striker by Lyon's price. It's not all about Beckham in France today. Didier Deschamps has also named his team for next week's friendly against Germany. As you can see, not many of Les Bleus are left in Ligue 1, and it'll be interesting to see whether anyone manages over the next few hours to prise the excellent Capoue away from Toulouse, who are determined to continue resisting offers after losing Sissoko to Newcastle. Goalkeepers: MickaÃ«l Landreau (Bastia), Hugo Lloris (Tottenham), Steve Mandanda (Marseille). Defenders: GaÃ«l Clichy (Manchester City), Patrice Evra (Manchester United), Mathieu Debuchy (Newcastle), Laurent Koscielny (Arsenal), Adil Rami (Valencia), Bacary Sagna (Arsenal), Mamadou Sakho (PSG), RaphaÃ«l Varane (Real Madrid). Midfielders: Yohan Cabaye (Newcastle), Etienne Capoue (Toulouse), Maxime Gonalons (Lyon), Blaise Matuidi (PSG), Moussa Sissoko (Newcastle), Mathieu Valbuena (Marseille). Attackers: Romain Alessandrini (Rennes), Karim Benzema (Real Madrid), Olivier Giroud (Arsenal), BafÃ©timbi Gomis (Lyon), JÃ©rÃ©my MÃ©nez (Paris SG), Franck RibÃ©ry (Bayern Munich). Deeply undignified scenes in Paris where photographers and hacks scream at each other to get out of the way so they can get a better shot of Beckham holding the PSG jersey. What a rabble. Hoffenheim have found him behind a shed at Tottenham's old training ground and have agreed a deal to being him back to Germany. Beckham is a consummate professional. He says all the right things and is now orchestrating the press conference himself, making sure everyone in attendance gets a chance to ask a question. "Just to give you a head's up on some information I have," emails Karl Waters. "Now, I'm currently holidaying in Lisbon and decided to take a trip out to Porto's Estadio do Dragoao&nbsp;stadium. Who did I see in their car park being greeted by club officials? None other than high-profile ball boy Charlie Morgan. A good move afoot?" Beckham was asked precisely how much will be donated to charity on his behalf. He replied: "A very good figure ... that's one thing that we're very excited about, to be able to give a huge sum to a children's charity in Paris is special." Sitting beside him, Leonardo explains: "We are going to arrange that, we haven't yet had the time to organise everything. We just agreed on the concept and we will inform you all when it has been finalised." Lots of folks wondering whether this is some wheeze to enhance the reputation of PSG and Beckham while lightening taxable income. I don't know, but your inquisitiveness is admirable. And on that rather heartwarming note, I'm done for the day and shall be handing it over to Paul Doyle. Thanks for all your emails. Bye. David Beckham will not be paid for his time at PSG - his salary will go to a children's charity. Waddaguy. Sunderland have released Louis Saha. I forgot he was there. Is PSG a short-term project? "I don't see that. Wherever I've gone I'm 150% committed. I don't expect to come into this team and play every single game. I expect to help this team in any way possible. I don't expect to start. I have to work for that. It's up to the manager. I might have only signed a contract until the end of the season but I consider myself to be part of this club in the future in helping this club and the French league to grow." Why PSG and not the Premier League? "Because every club i have played for I have been successful with. I've always said that I'd never want to play for another English club because I have a lot of history with Manchester United. Unless it was Manchester United I wouldn't want to play for another Premiership team. How much can I give? I have a lot of experience in the game. Over 13 or 14 championships, played for some of the best clubs in the world and with some of the best players. I'm still fit. I've not lost any of my pace because I never really had any pace! I was very lucky to work with Carlo [Ancelotti] and Leo at AC Milan. Carlo is one of the best managers I have played for." Beckham: "I'm very lucky, I'm 37 years old and I got offered a lot of offers. More than I've probably had in my career. I chose Paris because I can see what the club are trying to do, the players the club are trying to bring in. Now there is a club that is going to have a lot of success over the next 10, 15, 20 years. For now, to be part of something that is growing is very exciting for me. I'm very excited and honoured." First question from the British media: "How's your French?" Definitely worth the price of a Eurostar ticket. Beckham says: "I haven't spoken French for a few years." ITV Woman's follow-up: "Can you give us one line of French?" "Je m'appelle David and j'ai trente-sept ans." "I'm very happy to be sitting next to Leo as well..." Leonardo chuckles and says "Thank you my liege." PSG's president says: "David has refused a lot of offers from many clubs from all over the world so that makes this very special for us. He's going to be with us for our PROJECT. We have a big dream to become one of the best clubs in Europe. David is very professional outside of the pitch and I'm sure he will add a big value to the club. I'm sure we're going to win lots of things with David and I'm very happy to sit next to David here presenting him at PSG." OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG JUSTIN BIEBER IS HERE I MEAN DAVID BECKHAM IS HERE OMG OMG OMG OMG #BIEBERFEVER Have any transfers actually happened today? Even Beckham's late for his press conference. Sky reporter: "Luciano, can you give a couple of words to Sky Sports News?" Luciano Becchio: "I can't really speak right now." Sky reporter: "Are you happy with your move?" Becchio: "Yes." And off he drove. Why do they show this? Aston Villa have confirmed the signing of midfielder Yacouba Sylla from Clermont Foot on a three-and-a-half year contract. That should do it. John Sitton has HAD HIS SAY on Mario Balotelli. Harry Redknapp speaketh again, but not in a car. I simply cannot be bothered to report what he has to say. "Alexander Doni has returned to Brazil, joining Botafogo on a free transfer from Liverpool," writes Andy Hunter. Thank you to Tom Skinner for this educational and informative video. David Beckham has passed his medical at PSG. His press conference is at 4pm. That's only 25 minutes away! What is this man doing on my television? Liverpool fans must be delighted to see Football Expert Christian Purslow in the Sky Sports studio. What he doesn't know about football... The following is happening: Jack Butland has zoomed into Stoke's training ground ahead of his £5m move from Birmingham. The following is happening: "Enjoying the madness that is transfer deadline day and thought I would chime in with what is perhaps the dumbest rumour heard across Europa yet," says David Barnwell. "According to Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet, Schalkeâ€™s Kyriakos Papadopoulos is one of â€œseveral possibilitiesâ€� in Superliga club SÃ¸nderjyskE (currently 9th in league with 21 pts in 20 games). Footy news site bold.dk managed to get a hold of the Greekâ€™s agent, who in disbelief asked if this was supposed to be a joke: â€œIs this a joke? You think a player worth 20 million would play in a Danish club I never head about? This has to be the biggest joke I have heard in 10 years. I donâ€™t know the club, I donâ€™t know the sporting director. Never heard of them.â€� I guess thatâ€™s ruled out then. Shame really, he would added some real value to the bottom of the Superliga... Mind you, this was an actual story and not some trumped up rumor from a fan forum. This actually made one of the biggest papers in this country. Oh the lolz...." Twitter is down. Run for the hills! Gather food! Fetch your loved ones! Not necessarily in that order! Here's Stuart James. There's been lots of speculation about Darren Bent's future at Aston Villa, all the more so after Paul Lambert subbed him at half-time during the 2-1 defeat against Newcastle on Tuesday, but I've been told that it's unlikely the striker will be going anywhere in this window.&nbsp; You'll be wanting the latest on Alvaro Negredo not going to Everton, won't you? Allow Andy Hunter to fill that void. Alvaro Negredo to Everton is "impossible", according to the Spanish striker's agent. It was always an ambitious move that rested onSevilla's willingness to significantly reduce their 15m euro asking price and they won't play ball. The rotters. Negredo's agent, Juanma Lopez, has said of the one-time Tottenham target: "It's impossible. Negredo is an important player for Sevilla and I am absolutely sure nothing will be done in this window. I know they have spoken to Everton but there is no way it will happen. Unfortunately there is no chance because Sevilla simply don't want to lose him, and if they do they will ask for crazy money." Are you sitting down? Good. Mike Ashley has left Newcastle's training ground in his helicopter. What could this possibly mean? Are Newcastle going to sign a player, or a helicopter? Find out here. Do not click off this page. Do. Not. Leave. Someone has done a word cloud of this month's Rumour Mill. I don't know whether to be very impressed or very worried. Danny Graham is letting words fall out of his face. I've returned at just the right time. OK, that's all from me for this afternoon. I'm going to leave you in the very capable hands of Jacob Steinberg who has just been dragged kicking and screaming back into the office and re-chained to his desk. Thanks for your time and your faxes, and enjoy endure the rest of transfer deadline day. As for me? I'm off to Stoke where I plan to spend the next nine or 10 hours standing behind Rob Dorsett outside the Britannia Stadium making faces like this ... Patrick O'Dea writes: "My cousin Alecc is a waiter in Red Lobster is New York," he says. "He just served Richard Dunne a large bowl of apple crumble and a chocolate milkshake. On the move to the Red Bulls possibly?" Or just very hungry. He won't be playing too much football if he keeps eating that kind of rubbish. Gary Hooper to Norwich City news: This just in - Celtic have refused Norwich City's fourth bid for their star striker. Gary Hooper to Norwich City news: There is no Gary Hooper to Norwich City news. Oh, hold on, there is - Celtic have just refused Norwich City's fourth bid for their star striker. On Sky Sports News: Hayley McQueen has just read out an email from a viewer who wrote in to say that he took the day off work so that he could stand outside Hibernian's training ground to keep tabs on any comings or goings. Can you top that? If you've ever done anything more comically desperate in the name of football fandom, please let us know. And in case you're wondering, it's currently 6 degrees and raining in Edinburgh. More from the Guardian's Dominic Fifield, who is still seething because George Boyd signed for Nottingham Forest rather than Crystal Palace. "Alou Diarra is leaving West Ham for Rennes, initially on loan but with a view to a £2m permanent transfer," he reveals. "He was a free transfer arrival from Marseille last summer and will return to France to replace Yann M'Vila in the Rennes midfield following his move to Rubin Kazan." Guardian chief football writer Daniel Taylor has been in touch to directly contradict Irish Brendan in Brazil's attempt to rubbish the DamiÃ£o-to-Tottenham Hotspur speculation. Mr Taylor says that Tottenham Hotspur are definitely in for the Brazilian striker as, despite Andre Villas-Boas saying that he wouldn't be signing anyone, he desperately needs a centre-forward. Regarding the logistics of getting DamiÃ£o to London in time to sign before the dealine, he can of course be signed subject to a medical and besides ... Spurs occasionally have deadline day lock-ins when they sign players after hours. The Newcastle United-supporting striker has signed a three-and-a-half year deal with Sunderland, who will pay Swansea £5m for his services.&nbsp; Sound the transfer klaxon! We have news of a deal ... This from Brendan, an Irish Spurs fan in Brazil: "With DamiÃ£o in Brazil, and with me knowing it´s an&nbsp;11 hour flight from&nbsp;SÃ¢o Paulo to Heathrow, not including domestic flight from Porto Alegre, traffic on the North Circular, 3rd party ownership to sort out (a la Moutinho), signatures from the Tottenham board taking ages (a la Charlie Adam), fax machines breaking down (a la 1987) ... can we nip this DamiÃ£o thing in the bud?" What DamiÃ£o thing? Who's DamiÃ£o? Paul White writes. "I&nbsp;believe&nbsp;Chris Renwick is correct, legality is the&nbsp;issue&nbsp;re: the use of fax machines," he says. "I know this from personal experience as I was in change of organizing 3&nbsp;tenants&nbsp;for a rented house when at a leasing agents&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;contract&nbsp;had to be signed by all on the same day even though they were dotted&nbsp;around&nbsp;the county. Not exactly a gripping&nbsp;anecdote&nbsp;but beats your George Boyd news by a mile." That was Dominic Fifield's news and I think anyone with the surname White, whose first name isn't Jim, is in a position to criticise anyone for being dull on this of all days. â€¢ David Beckham is en route to PSG for a medical â€¢ Mario Balotelli has finalised his move to AC Milan â€¢ Swansea striker Danny Graham is at Sunderland to discuss personal terms and do a medical â€¢ Norwich City have tabled a bid for Celtic striker Gary Hooper â€¢ Newcastle owner Mike Ashley arrived at work in a helicopter â€¢ Chris Samba has joined QPR for £12.5m and will be paid the risibly small sum of £100,000 per week. â€¢ Norwich have signed Luciano Becchio with Steve Morison heading off to Leeds. â€¢ Stoke have bid £4m and the loan of two players (one of whom is Ryan Shotton) for Birmingham City goalkeeper Jack Butland. If you thought that 50 Cent video was a bit extreme and edgy, wait til you get a load of this advert for the&nbsp;Amstrad Fax FX9600AT, which was broadcast on television in 1991. Tip of the hat to my colleague Daniel Harris for digging this out - you'll all want one now. Fax update: "50 Cent has a fax machine in his car, which he boasted about in song," writes Ryan Dunne, referring to the "stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone" lyric from High All The Time (warning: parental advisory - potty mouthed lyrics. Plus smoking that "good s**t" and being high all the time is neither big nor clever). A desperate Villa fan writes: "Any news on Florent Malouda joining Villa?" asks Pa Bridgeman. "Or anyone else ... anyone! Do you fancy a game on Saturday?" Sorry Pa, I was a hopelessly inadequate left-back in my day, but I don't think I was quite slapstick enough to earn a starting berth in this Aston Vi ... what? A preposterously large signing on fee and £50,000 per week you say? With Darren Bent coming to work for the Guardian as a make-weight? Go on then, I'll play. It's only Everton away, after all. Tortured Deadline Day Fax Machine riff update II "Isn't it the case that faxes can be submitted for legal reasons and business deals, whereas e-mail doesn't have that status yet?" asks Chris Renwick. "So, basically, if you fax a signed contract it's a legally done deal, with the hard copies to follow. If you do it by e-mail, it doesn't count. Of course, none of that explains why they can't be better organised and not leave everything until the last minute. If it were down to me, I'd propose a transfer window of 24 hours." Tortured Deadline Day Fax Machine riff update: Gareth Dobson has faxed in a response to Tony Cowards's query of 1:18pm. "Has Tony ever tried to print off a contract, get it signed, rescan it all, save it as a PDF and then email the document over?" he asks. "Trust me it's worse than a fax machine." Jack Butland to Stoke update. It seems Stoke have offered Birmingham less than £4m, but are prepared to send two players - one of them Ryan Shotton - on loan to Birmingham City as part of any deal. There's also talk that if Butland does sign for Stoke, he may see out the rest of the season at Birmingham. In other Stoke news, Peter Crouch and Tony Pulis have just left the training ground (separately) and, according to Sky's man on the spot, Rob Dorsett, speculation is rife over where they might be going. Home? For lunch? To the bookies? NOBODY KNOWS!!! "He's a player that I've always, always admired. I think he's top, top, top!" Should any Sky Sports News reporters find themselves being interrupted, disturbed or video-bombed by bored football fans later, they might want to take a leaf out of this reporter's book (spotter's badge: Sunday Independent chief football writer Dion Fanning). "Peterborough's George Boyd is currently undergoing a medical at Nottingham Forest after agreeing personal terms," he writes. "He's out of contract at London Road in the summer and is costing a little over £500,000." This is a rather surprising turn of events, considering that Boyd, a lank-haired midfielder, was reported to be in talks with Crystal Palace this time yesterday after the two clubs had agreed terms over the transfer. Boyd joinmed Forest on loan rtowards the end of the 2009-10 season but failed to impress enough at the time to earn himself a permanent deal. ESPN's Kelly Cates tweets ... Tony Cowards has a question. "How come football clubs still conduct business by fax?" he asks. "Sod goal line technology, how about some deadline technology?" Anyone know? Surely football clubs have heard of email and printers. Exciting helicopter news. Well, helicopter news. The wingless whirly-bird which brought Danny Graham and his agent to Sunderland is unable to take off because of windy weather conditions. Graham's agent also represents Jermaine Jenas and David Bentley and will need to get to London in a hurry once Graham has inked his deal with Sunderland, to try and prise as much money as possible out of the west London outfit on behalf of his other clients. Sky Sources reveal he may have to jump on a train instead. Rob Dorsett, Sky Sports News's man standing in the cold outside Stoke City's training ground has confirmed that the Potters have now tabled a formal bid for Birmingham City goalkeeper Jack Butland, believed to be in the region of £4.5m. Should Stoke seal the deal, would Butland's arrival bring a smile to this man's face? Guardian sources (specifically Twitter) have told me Leeds are expected to complete the free transfer of Stephen Warnock from Aston Villa some time this afternoon. Leeds will also be signing Steve Morison from Norwich, with the striker heading north as part of the deal that brought Luciano Becchio to Carrow Road. Good afternoon all. As I type this opening entry of my short stint monitoring today's wheeling and dealing, Sky Sports News are conveniently rounding up selected highlights of the transfer deadline day thus far ... â€¢ A man has got out of a helicopter in Newcastle â€¢ A younger, fitter man has got out of a car in Sunderland. â€¢ A man is on his way to Paris, where he will cough for the doctor. â€¢ Another man has signed a £100,000-per-week contract with QPR. â€¢ Norwich have tabled a bid for Celtic striker Gary Hooper. Ok gang, I'm off for a break now. It's been too exciting. I'll leave this blog to Ireland's very own Jim White, Mr Barry Glendenning. Fulham have now signed Urby Emanuelson on loan until the end of the season. It looks like Danny Graham has signed for Sunderland if this picture is anything to go by... Urby Emanuelson is close to joining Fulham on loan from Milan. Martin Jol had him at Ajax. This is interesting from Stuart James. Interested in the reports this morning that QPR will pay Christopher Samba £100k a week. Samba will have to reassess his outgoings in London if that turns out to be the case because I've just been told that he was earning £147,000 a week after tax for Anzhi Makhachkala. Nice work, if you can get it. Here's what Harry Redknapp has had to say. â€œThis is an unbelievable signing.Tony Fernandes deserves a lot of credit for this one â€“ he has worked so hard on bringing him in. I was speaking with him a month ago and he asked me who I would want to sign if Ryan Nelsen left, he asked me to give him a couple of names. I said to him, â€˜Well, these arenâ€™t possible to get but if youâ€™re asking me who Iâ€™d have, Iâ€™ll give you a couple of players.â€™ One of them was Chris Samba.The next thing I know heâ€™s telling me that heâ€™s working on bringing him in! Itâ€™s amazing. Chris is just what we need. Heâ€™s a monster. Great in the air, quick, a leader, strong, fantastic in both boxes, hard as nails. Heâ€™s a proper centre-half.â€� And more from Samba. Iâ€™m delighted to be back in the Premier League. Itâ€™s the best league in the world to play football. With Harry here though, he is really passionate and he wants to do something with the club. Unfortunately things havenâ€™t gone the way the club would have wanted so far this season but thereâ€™s still a lot of time and Iâ€™m sure we can get out of it. I know what is going on with the project here. There is a very important fan base, Iâ€™ve played at Loftus Road before and itâ€™s fantastic. The club is ambitious and Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s a good challenge for me. If I can be a part of it I will be very proud, it will be a great achievement for me. I wouldnâ€™t be here if I didnâ€™t believe we could get out of trouble.â€� Asked why he signed for QPR, Samba said: "I know it's a project. I know Tony and Harry have an ambitious vision for the club. I like to work with people with a vision like that. When I see the squad it's very, very good players." And Christopher Samba has signed for QPR. Looking at it purely from what he offers on the pitch, that's a cracking signing. He's signed a four-and-a-half year deal after moving from Anzhi Makhachkala. Christopher Samba has been tweeting. His move to QPR must be close to completion. "I spoke to gus hiddink and promess him and the boys I will come say bye ASAP. anzhi will be a fantastic club anyway with the quality they ve got. I had a fantastic year at anzhi will never forget the support the fan gave me I met only fantastic people in Dagestan. my reason for leaving is to be closer to my family and my 2 little boys" Norwich have signed Luciano Becchio with Steve Morison heading off to Leeds. Becchio has scored 19 goals for Leeds this season, while Morison has struggled for games this season. Here's Mr Jamie Jackson with news from Manchester. Sir Alex Ferguson was asked last night after Manchester United's 2-1 defeat of Southampton if there would be any signings today and he said, not unexpectedly:&nbsp;"We are not going to sign anyone tomorrow." The situation at Manchester City may be slightly more fluid. The club sent out a denial regarding a David Villa story that had appeared on Wednesday which was strong enough to leave little wriggle room should he be signed... Also, City have been consistent that there will be no replacement for Mario Balotelli... But this being football... Gary Cotterill is in absolutely brilliant form today. The man who once tried to interview a moving car on live television has just tried to interview Milan's Nigel de Jong about his thoughts about Mario Balotelli's arrival. He asked De Jong over and over again - brave man - before Xabi Alonso's mate looked out of his car, said "sorry mate, I'm on the phone" and then drove off. Is there no end to the Andros Townsend drama? Having seemed set to sign for QPR, now the deal appears to be off. It's a mystery and no mistake. SKY EXCLUSIVE: "Ok, strap yourselves in, it's 12 o'clock, it's lunchtime, we're into the afternoon." Sky now understand the very concept of time. Here's Andy Hunter with the latest on Liverpool. As Brendan Rodgers said at Arsenal last night, Liverpool do not expect to add to the January signings of Daniel Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho on deadline day. An offer remains on the table for Tom Ince but there has been no contact with Blackpool for several weeks. Could be a few out-goings though. Daniel Pacheco is close to joining Spanish second division club Sociedad Deportiva Huesca on loan and the contract of Brazilian goalkeeper Doni could be cancelled today. Birmingham have now received a bid for from Stoke for from Jack Butland. The official figure is unknown. Butland has already turned down a move to Chelsea because he wants regular first-team football. Asmir Begovic has said he's going nowhere though. Expect a couple of other clubs to come in for Butland, I say. Fulham are thought to be interested. Here's Midland correspondent Stuart James. Norwich City have been frustrated in their attempts to sign Curtis Davies from Birmingham City. Birmingham have rejected an improved £1.5m offer plus a player, with a further £500,000 guaranteed, for the central defender. Chris Hughton, the Norwich manager, worked with Davies at St Andrew's last season and is keen to be reunited with the 27-year-old, who would relish the chance to play in the Premier League again. Birmingham paid Aston Villa £2.4m for Davies two years ago. At this stage it looks unlikely that Norwich will increase their bid. OUTGOING! Alejandro Faurlin has completed his loan move to Palermo from QPR. "Not sure about the whole Danny Graham thing â€“ Oâ€™Neill has very rarely played two strikers up top for us since he came to the club, and we still have Connor Wickham kicking his heels on the bench most weeks," says Richard Thompson. "Donâ€™t see how Graham will start that often, and Iâ€™d much rather we signed another creative midfielder/winger with the £5.5m fee instead. Still, Iâ€™m off to Rio tomorrow, so what do I care?!" You care. Correction and clarifications department: John Stones is not buying Wigan. This day frazzles us all. Sky Sports News are now "understanding" something which is freely available for everyone to read on PSG's website. Is there anything that's beyond their understanding? Barnsley have accepted a £3m bid from Wigan for John Stones. Do your thing, Roll-up Man. "Andros Townsend is really hard to tackle," says Laurence Thomas. "My shins found this out the painful way when he turned up as a ringer for an informal&nbsp;5-a-side tournament I played in with work last summer. Questions were immediately raised by his lack of obligatory beer-gut." Former Tottenham goalkeeper news: Paul Robinson should sign for West Ham from Blackburn with Stephen Henderson going the other way while Heurelho Gomes is flying to Germany to complete a loan move to Hoffenheim. A nice little stat from Britain's self-proclaimed leading football statistician Duncan Alexander here. Sky are saying that Fulham's chief executive Alistair Mackintosh is locked in his office. The work of pranksters? He can be heard banging on the door and shouting "Let me out! Let me out! I've got to go and sign David Ngog from Bolton." Which is something Fulham are actually trying to do. "The gentleman in the car with 'Arry looks suspiciously like this feller," says Matt Reed. "Only more confused." There will be a press conference at 5pm local time in Paris to unveil David Beckham. Unveil's a weird word, isn't it? It's not as if we don't all know who David Beckham is and what it is he does. Bordeaux have ruled out a loan move for Modibo Maiga because West Ham won't pay his wages. Which is rude of them. Here's David 'Dave' Hytner, one of our London football writers, with Arsenal news. Are they signing anyone? Trust you're suitably revved up, although am slightly disappointed that you've been denied your dream Jim White role today. Something that might be of interest regarding Arsenal. Warning: the following Arsene Wenger comment after last night's Liverpool game contains an attempt at humour. "I cannot promise you that," Wenger said, when asked whether he would make a signing before the deadline. "We work on it. We ask for an official extension of the transfer window now for one week ... maybe we will be capable to do that [buy someone]." "Jim Beam? Whisky?" says Richard Morris. "I think not. It is a Bourbon, in that it hails from Kentucky and is primarily distilled from corn. You might have got away with it if you had referred to it as 'whiskey', the e often being added to denote a spirit similar to the Scottish variety but hailing from other shores. But whisky? Dear me no." Sorrey. It's being reported that Danny Graham is on his way to Sunderland ahead of a £5.5m move from Swansea. Fletcher and Graham? That's a pretty handy front two. It sounds like Luciano Becchio has passed his medical at Norwich and his move should be completed in the next couple of hours. Is there anyone from Leeds who Norwich won't be signing? Ok, this is actually interesting. Move over Zlatan, there's a new star in town. It appears that David Beckham is on his way to Paris for a medical at PSG. Nice shops in Paris. Dominic Fifield brings us news of Mr Townsend. And there's been a change. Andros Townsend not having a medical at QPR as yet, apparently. Rangers need to move on a few players first, by the look of things. Junior Hoilett, perhaps. And Jamie Mackie. We should have seen the latter coming given that Harry Redknapp stated on Monday, and I quote: "I haven't thought about Jamie Mackie going. He plays in my team every week so he's not a player that I'm looking to shift." "Is Andros Townsend any good?" says Ian Burch. "Heâ€™s one of the many Spurs players who have been on loan at the Orient over the last few years and the only one of them who has looked half decent. He has the speed to get past full-backs, but cannot deliver a cross and runs into cul-de-sacs when he gets near the box, I assume heâ€™ll be taking Shaun Wright-Phillipsâ€™s place then." Here are some quotes from Balotelli about his move to Meelan. He's signed a contract until June 2017. "For sure I will remember my brilliant team-mates, the manager and all the supporters. They are the best, they were great with me and I will always have a very special place in my heart for City, it's a great club with a great future. I thank them for all of their support of me. Maybe one day we will see each other again." As the clock strikes 11am, here's a full list of all the transfers to have been completed so far: Wigan have signed Paul Scharner on loan from Hamburg. Mario Balotelli has gone to Milan. This is very exciting. What does Roll-up Man think? I'm exceptionally proud of that one. I've just won Jim White Day. "I'm calling BS on the guy being called "Jim Beam" in your 10.52 post," says Noel Markham. "Admit it, you're just trying to liven things up by slipping funny names into the stories!" It's a whisky business for journalists to make things up. "I feel Sky should move their deadline day studio to O2 arena and do it live," says Jim Beam. "Harry could drive on the stage for an interview, some dart before 7 so the atmosphere is on top when Jim White enter the stage. The independent bookies from the race tracks could take bets on next transfers, maybe move the summer deadline day to Wembley stadium, only Sky is the limit." Ant and Dec hosting. Sky Sports News have exclusive footage of a helicopter landing at Newcastle's training ground? Is it Ryan Babel? Is it? No, it's Mike Ashley. Tottenham's Andros "Andy" Townsend is having a medical at Queens Park Rangers. Is he any good? He's meant to have some potential, isn't he? But he's got very little Premier League experience, so I'm not sure if QPR fans will be getting too excited about this. "I was wanting to ask you what your thoughts are on Arsenal signing anyone at all this transfer window and if so, who should they get?" says the Kyle Walker. "I'm not optimistic that they'll sign anyone personally; the football press (in particular Goal.com) has been churning out increasingly ridiculous names, leading up to that depressingly inevitable three days where people genuinely thought that Wenger was going to crack open the long-discussed yet never-seen Arsenal war-chest and splash the cash on Edinson Cavani over an unheard of sixteen year old Belgian with allegedly "great potential"." I suspect they're not going to sign any one because, you know, Wenger. But if there is a chance for them to sign David Villa, they'd be mad not to take it. There's also talk of a move for Momo Diame from West Ham, but it's all quiet on that front for the time being. Valenciennes president Jean-Raymond Legrand has said that he is talking with three Premier League clubs about a deal for the central defender Nicolas Isimat-Mirin. "We are now discussing with West Ham, Fulham and Newcastle," he told RMC. "We have set a requirement to keep the player until June. But should he leave, in this case, we will consider recruiting a player." "How dare you think you could even get near replacing the loyal Kevin Bond?" says Peter Wilson. "Do you have what it takes to drive from Sandbanks to London everyday and back again? Are you able to spot a roaming news camera team from 200 metres and stop precisely where itâ€™s needed ensuring you havenâ€™t accidentally put the central window locks on? I donâ€™t think so Steinberg. Back to your typing son!" Here's Dominic Fifield with news from Reading. Bit on Thomas Ince, who had been the subject of a £6.5m bid from Reading with Blackpool holding out for £8m... Brian McDermott confirmed last night that he doesn't anticipate the winger leaving the Championship club before the deadline, which presumably leaves him open to a move to Liverpool in the summer if interest is maintained. â€œThomas won't be coming here," said McDermott. "Blackpool are very strong about wanting to keep him. I'd be amazed if Blackpool lose him in this window. My gut feeling is they've managed to keep him.â€�Reading are trying to do one more deal today, apparently, which McDermott rated as "50:50". I'm now reporting to you live from Harry Redknapp's car. Brek Shea is at Stoke's training ground but there are doubts over whether the USA international will get a work permit. Mario Balotelli has gone to Milan by the way. Is this news? I don't think this is news. Bye, Mario. I'm already over you. Totally over you. The Guardian's Merseyside correspondent Andy Hunter has emailed in with news about Everton. Everton would like to make two signings today, hence the reason for calling off Leroy Fer's proposed £8.6m move from FC Twente on Wednesday afternoon. The Seville striker Alvaro Negredo is one ambitious and pricey target, with a 15m euro price-tag as the Spaniards look to ease their financial problems. It may take some compromise for Everton to land the Spain international. As previously mentioned, Ruben Castro of Real Betis is another striking option. David Moyes also wants an attacking midfield player but, despite constant rumours about Marouane Fellaini going to Chelsea, Everton continue to insist there will be no major departures. Time will tell. "If you are Jim White then who from The Guardian team is your Natalie Sawyer?" says Mark Judd. Lutz points out that he's talked to Natalie Sawyer, so I think he's stepping forward. "Christopher Samba left the country because no one wanted him," says Geoff Saunders. "Now QPR pay a fortune for a transfer and pay him £100k a week. Madness. Simply madness. But thank you for the pic of 'Arry in the passenger seat, at least we now know what Kevin Bond does." Samba is a great signing, in mine, but I'd be very worried by what's going on if I was a QPR fan. It has more than a whiff of the Portsmouths about it. Every time there's a transfer, I will celebrate by going around the office doing this. Here's Harry Redknapp in action. Look at him. He's pretending he wants to get out of there but we all know he's loving it. Apparently Everton are interested in the Real Betis forward Ruben Castro. The 31-year old has 15 goals and 2 assists from 22 matches this season. With Nikica Jelavic in a horrible run of form, they could do with a new striker for David Moyes to ruin. "As is stands it is doubtful that Gary Hooper will go to Norwich City, though this could change," says The Guardian's Manchester correspondent Jamie Jackson, who's refusing to get off that fence. Get off the fence, Jamie! What number will Hooper be wearing at Norwich? Is it announced that Wigan have signed Paul Scharner on loan. And what's more, Charisma Curbzzzzzzz is on Sky Sports News now. That's right, it's Roll-up Man, who we'll be unveiling every time there's a rubbish transfer. Danny Graham's representatives have ruled out a move to Middlesbrough. Poor Middlesbrough! "If Jeremy Smith is right about the Villa having signed a player called Scylla, might their next acquisition be one called Charybdis, to please classics buffs?" says Charles Antaki. "And also to make their back line more fearsome with a whirlpool and a sea-monster and respectively?" Christopher Samba is reportedly going to earn £100,000 a week at QPR, where he has passed a medical. It's lucky that Harry Redknapp isn't going to pull Tony Fernandes's trousers down. You can't really do that to your boss. Thank you to Kevin Josling for this. "Are you sure the horn-beeping car behind Harry is not that of another manager, keen to get some window-interview last day transfer action, the same way other managers copied Wenger's&nbsp;nutrition&nbsp;and training initiatives or everyone started doing Moneyball?" says Ryan Dunne. That would be good, wouldn't it. Just a line of managers, in cars, waiting to speak to a Sky reporter and say "No, I haven't heard anything about that." The surprise news of the day so far is that Middlesbrough, not Sunderland, have agreed a deal for Danny Graham. Graham started his career there. That would be a superb signing for Middlesbrough - I really rate him, but I rate Michu a bit higher, you won't be surprised to learn. And on this subject, Elliot Carr-Barnsley writes: "Surely Danny Graham can do better than Boro! Or has he heard good things about the sunny seaside town of Redcar, famous for its racecourse?" Social Networking's Peter Odemwingie speaks. Very cryptic. Sky's Gary Cotterill just pronounced it Serie Eh. It's going to be a long day, isn't it. "It seems that Aston Villa have moved to address their over-reliance on young, inexperienced lower league players by signing a young, inexperienced player from Ligue 2 (Yacouba Scylla from Clermont Ferrand)," says Jeremy Smith. "Congratulations on being the Jim White of Guardian sport!" says Ryan Dunne. "Frankly, I think you could do a lot worse. As well as being naturally enthusiastic and even experimenting with (an admittedly sub-"Warnie" but still) talk show, Jim White's also a big Glorious Glasgow Rangers fan!" Any excuse. The sound of a car horn behind Harry Redknapp's car. Oh my! Don't they know what day this is? Harry Redknapp is speaking out of a car window. This is actually happening. Oh, and it looks like it may be a striker-tastic day for Norwich. They've bid for Celtic's Gary Hooper (a bid that was rejected) and are in talks with Leeds about signing another striker, Luciano Becchio. Jacob isn't in quite yet â€“ the Tube has gone into meltdown at the prospect of deadline day â€“ so here's some early news for you. Christopher Samba has passed a medical at QPR while Middlesbrough have agreed a fee of £5m with Swansea for striker Danny Graham. Hello and welcome to coverage of Jim White Day which, with any luck, will see him suffer the same fate as Frasier Crane on Frasier Crane Day, stuck in a tube overlooking Sky Towers while someone else leads the rendition of Auld Lang Syne or whatever else it is we're supposed to be doing at 11pm tonight. Those of you unfortunate enough to have seen the ads will know that we're all invited to a party with Jim White and Natalie Sawyer - BYOBB (the extra b's a typo) - to celebrate wildly as Peter Crouch completes a last-minute move to QPR. Oh yes, it's expected to be a busy day down at Loftus Road. Harold Redknapp has rolled down his car window and is hoping to sign t'rific players like Christopher Samba, Jermaine Jenas, Andros Townsend and David Bentley, who will hopefully tip a bucket of icy water on his new manager in his first press conference. Just like old times! Is Robbie Keane available? There are, of course, many more deals to keep your peepers on throughout the day but the main entertainment will, as ever, be found at Tottenham, where Daniel Levy will haggle and haggle and haggle over a much-needed new striker before Spurs sign Andy Booth on loan at 11.03pm and Andre Villas-Boas sits in a corner and weeps.

bodytext: The January transfer window has always been a sellers' market, so the behaviour of buying clubs is a barometer of their blood pressure, on a scale ranging from contented to chaotic. Those who are content with where they are in the league decline to buy in haste at inflated prices and stick with squads they are generally happy with until the saner market of the summer. There are itchily ambitious clubs or those who cannot help themselves â€“ Roman Abramovich's Chelsea, paying Liverpool £50m for Fernando Torres two years ago, is forever the classic example â€“ but there were none in that impulsive bracket this time. In fact, considering this transfer window played out under the billowing prospect of £5bn expected for the Premier League's three-year TV deals from next season, there has been a notable measure of calm and evidence of more strategic, professional recruitment than some trolley dashes of old. Newcastle signed five French players, but say they were not knee-jerking at the sudden glimpse of the relegation zone but responding to it responsibly by bringing forward the signing of players they had tracked for some time. So, in a climate now characterised by more careful, statistics-based assessment of players' abilities and the financial implications, all of football looked at Queens Park Rangers' dealings as a club edging towards red on the barometer. Given the probable £60m a low-ranking Premier League club will be paid from television alone next season, compared with about £2m (plus parachute payments) for clubs in the Championship, it is natural to strain sinews to stay up. Tony Fernandes, QPR owner for only 18 months, was praised by his manager, Harry Redknapp, for spending £12.5m to buy out Christopher Samba's gilt-edged contract with Anzhi Makhachkala. That followed the £8m spent on LoÃ¯c Remy from Marseille, a deal worked on by the agent Willie McKay, a veteran of transfers from France to England, and so humble Loftus Road was the stand-out temple of extravagance in this transfer window. Samba's adviser, Walid Bouzid, said his client is not being paid the reported £100,000 weekly wage at Loftus Road but that the money is certainly "Premier League sized" and does not include a clause to decrease it if, despite these signings, QPR are relegated. Spending £20.5m in transfer fees and committing to many millions more in wages to two good players may be a rational effort by Fernandes to avoid greater losses if QPR are relegated but it is also a big-money January gamble. It is barely 18 months since a tough, muscular side managed by Neil Warnock convincingly won promotion to the Premier League and, having sacked Warnock and backed Mark Hughes to assemble a new collection last year, paying £6.8m in agents' fees, Fernandes should wonder how it came to this. Around him are clubs steadily increasing the sophistication of their scouting and signing of players, in the context of financial fair play which is promoting responsible spending. In the relegation zone Reading are not panicking in similar fashion, perhaps accepting that going down can keep a club strong if the Premier League bonanza has not been blown. Southampton's radical action to stay up was the brutal replacement of the manager, Nigel Adkins, with Mauricio Pochettino, rather than spending millions on players. Newcastle acknowledge their French signings in January were partly a response to finding Alan Pardew's squad sliding down the league but argue that the strategy helmed by the managing director, Derek Llambias, with the chief scout, Graham Carr, has identified good value nevertheless. By contrast the decision by Aston Villa's owner, Randy Lerner, not to sign any players now might come to seem like paralysis rather than confidence that Villa's form will improve between now and May. At clubs in safer regions of the table the general lack of panic buying, or very much newsworthy activity, speaks of a satisfaction with squads likely to ensure survival at least in the golden league. Swansea's chairman, Huw Jenkins, had said they identified two or three potential targets to strengthen Michael Laudrup's squad now but, with terms and conditions not being ideal and the team surpassing expectations, they had the luxury of waiting until the summer. Towards the top Arsenal expressed customary forbearance, while Everton and Tottenham Hotspur both worked hard to secure quality signings who could help grasp the fourth Champions League place. Manchester City always said, in the first flushes of Sheikh Mansour's mountainous spending, that they had a strategy, supported by a director of football structure, and would not continue splashing out every window. This time City, who are confident they will pass Uefa's financial fair play assessment next year, bought no new players, only selling â€“ Mario Balotelli for a satisfactory £17m plus add-ons. Manchester United, top of the league, were never going to indulge too much in January but pocketed Wilfried Zaha for the future. At Chelsea Abramovich sated his oligarch's impulses by introducing Rafael BenÃ­tez as interim manager and, despite his team's imperfections, offered no repeat of the Torres drama. Liverpool, financial fair play devotees, now operate a line of decision-making via Michael Edwards, head of performance and analysis. Their £12m signing of Daniel Sturridge and £8.5m spent on Philippe Coutinho do not quite look like Michu-like steals for a new edition of Moneyball. But still the club's owners, Fenway Sports Group, getting to grips with soccer, must look back and wonder how, in their first weeks in charge, they allowed themselves to blow the Torres money by spending £35m on Andy Carroll. Gradually â€“ away from QPR â€“ times are changing.

bodytext: â€¢ Interesting development in the capital, where mayor Boris seeks to prove he has the mettle to rule, as well as the vocabulary. He's a man for the tough decisions, quite unlike PM Dave. Backbenchers take note. Labour, Lib Dems and Greens on London's fire authority (LFEPA) conspired to block his fire service cuts, which was really jolly mean of them. But no matter. Boris is using mayoral powers to push them to fruition. And what does Michael Gove think of that? Well, he probably won't be telling us, because if he did it would be clear that the Tories are all over the place. But luckily we know, because in 2007, Gove â€“ then a shadow minister â€“ had a few things to say about the use of mayoral diktat in circumstances such as this. "We are particularly concerned about what is proposed in respect of the power of mayoral direction to LFEPA. Because of the consensual way in which LFEPA works, the use of mayoral direction powers suggests that it has been incapable of resolving a problem and that the mayor comes in to cut the Gordian knot. In such circumstances, there is an implied threat to LFEPA's accountability." More than that, he said: "Individuals in LFEPA who might wish to operate to an agenda dictated by the mayor could act as a fifth column, disrupting the currently effective consensual working of LFEPA and hoping that the mayor's powers of direction might subsequently be exercised to favour a minority over the existing consensus. It would not be appropriate for the mayor's powers to be exercised in such circumstances." Of course, the mayor then was Ken Livingstone, and City Hall belonged to Labour, but Gove's a principled man. No doubt he'll be taking the fight to Boris. â€¢ Little is heard these days of Lord Justice Leveson, although his sidekick Robert Jay does appear to be enjoying himself on the lecture circuit. Their work is finished, but with a wider remit they might have noted the flight from journalistic standards at the New York Times. "The Media Equation column on Monday, about the animated comedy show South Park and its creators, misstated a plot point in the show," says the paper, fessing up. "While the character Kenny was once&nbsp;killed in every episode, that is no&nbsp;longer the case. The column also misstated the circumstances of his repeated deaths. While Kenny met his fate in a variety of ways over the years, he was not routinely 'ritually sacrificed'." Mind-boggling, really. One hopes the culprit did the decent thing. â€¢ A trip to one of the prison establishments run by G4S not far from London, and we pitch up in the visitors' waiting room. There, along with dire warnings about what happens if you try to smuggle in drugs, are instructions on the dress code for visitors. No hoodies, of course, no skirts above the knee or strapless or backless dresses, no T-shirts with offensive slogans. And "no string vests", the sign says. What has the humble string vest ever done to become taboo? Might one double up as a rope ladder? We should be told. â€¢ To France, where the steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal is working magic on a scale never seen before. After upsetting the French with his proposed sell-off â€“ later abandoned â€“ of part of the Florange steel plant, he now has Belgium up in arms. There were clashes on the streets over the weekend after he suddenly took his axe to 1,300 Walloon jobs, and now the French industry minister has weighed in on their behalf, accusing Mittal of "lies and blackmail". The French and Belgians have hurled insults at each other since Napoleon's day and yet here is Mittal, cutting through the enmity, bringing them together. They should thank him. One doubts they will. â€¢ Finally, he lives an ordinary life of sorts and takes the children to school, but when the camera starts to roll Sylvester Stallone is every bit the action hero. Sometimes he doesn't know when to stop. Have you ever fallen out with any of your fellow action heroes, asked ShortList magazine? Well, said Sly: "Steven Seagal said that he 'didn't associate with that kind of element' â€“ meaning me â€“ so I slammed him up against a wall." Those boys! Without someone to yell "cut", they're lost. Twitter: @hugh_muir
